                Since May 2025, CFS Engineering has been participating in an ESA-funded project focused on the development of a Mars Entry and Descent System. CFD simulations will be performed at points throughout the trajectories. This will provide a complete aerodynamic database, showing variation with Mach and angle of attack. CFS Engineering will reconstruct wind tunnel tests and will rebuild the T-IBU dynamic stability test at high subsonic/transonic conditions.
